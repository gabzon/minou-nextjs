# Product Guidelines

## Messaging & Tone
- **Sophisticated Playful:** Use a friendly, inviting, and slightly whimsical tone. Focus on storytelling and the joy of handmade items. Messaging should feel personal and artisanal, reflecting the "homemade" nature of the Minou brand.

## Visual Identity & UI
- **Soft & Rounded:** UI components (cards, buttons, containers) should use generous rounded corners (`rounded-xl` to `rounded-3xl`) to align with the playful brand vibe.
- **Pastel Accents:** Utilize the defined pastel palette (Mint, Blush, Butter) for background sections, badges, and interactive hover states to add color without overwhelming the product visuals.
- **Clean Typography:** Maintain a premium feel using "Plus Jakarta Sans" with ample whitespace. Ensure text is legible and hierarchically structured to guide the user's eye.

## Imagery Standards
- **9:16 Portrait Ratio:** All product photography (thumbnails, carousels, galleries) must strictly adhere to a 9:16 vertical aspect ratio.
- **High Fidelity:** Images must be sharp and high-resolution to showcase the intricate textures of polymer clay, the clarity of UV resin, and the details of gold plating.
- **Consistent Presentation:** Use clean, consistent backgrounds or carefully curated flatlays to ensure the colorful jewelry remains the central focus.

## Localization & Accessibility
- **Persistent Toggle:** The language toggle (Croatian/English) must be clearly visible and easily accessible in the global header at all times.
- **Mobile-First Navigation:** Prioritize thumb-friendly interactions, including easy-to-swipe carousels and a sticky bottom "Order" CTA on product detail pages.

## Interactions & Motion
- **Immersive & Fluid:** Implement smooth micro-interactions, such as subtle scale-up effects on product card hovers and fluid transitions between page sections.
- **State Feedback:** Provide clear visual cues for user actions, such as theme toggling (Light/Dark), language switching, and interactive buttons.
